            <p>It all began one rainy November day in 1972. Our story takes place in a cottage deep within the forests of the Pacific Northwest where Althea Suga resided with her husband, Sam Suga and their two children Trilby and Clyde.
                Though the little ones could still count their ages on one hand, they played an instrumental role in establishing the empire the family runs today.</p>
                <p>Althea dearly loved her children and she was commited to the task of raising them to be responsible, kind, considerate, hardworking adults.</p>
                <p>To accomplish her mission, she not only led by example, but she gave the children tasks to help out around the house. Feeding the chickens, walking
                the dog, drying the dishes- and when the children accomplished their respective to-do lists they were rewarded naturally. It was because of this reward system that Suga's base raised yeast donut recipe was born and 
                Althea's love of baking was realized.</p>
